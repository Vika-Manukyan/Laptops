# Laptops
### In this project I scraped 4 brands of laptops: Apple, Lenovo, Dell and HP from Amazon.com by their URL's.
I scraped the first 3 pages into a csv file (dirty data).
Then I cleaned data so I have a dataset with the following columns:
Title, URL, columns for parameters - (RAM, storage, price, rating, number of customer reviews) - (clean data).

Then after creating the dataset, I have visualized the following comparisons:
- Price VS Parameter,
- Rating VS Price
